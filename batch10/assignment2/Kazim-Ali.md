#Assignmenr 2 Kazim Ali

In Assignment 2 I have learned and used my knowledge from the past to create Containers by using Docker Commands . 

⦁	VM's take specific size of the hardware but docker are very flexible on the amount of work it take resources from the OS, docker is much lightweight and faster than VM.
⦁	docker provides kernel , operating level system virtualization , it shares the physical hardware of the host OS.
⦁	docker run -p8080:90 -d
⦁	docker run -port -network
⦁	docker logs container_id,container name
⦁	docker run image_name (if image does not exist locally it will download all the image layers) else if the image is in docker hub then docker pull image_name docker pull image_name


Alongside these I have implemented all the docker labs tasks , like creating a container , network , attaching a container with a network , Inspecting a network and container to see in details what goes behind , also I have ran the container on a specific port and checked by hitting the post that whether the container is running also checked the logs . I created a account at Docker hub as well and signed with my terminal to my remote docker repositories .
