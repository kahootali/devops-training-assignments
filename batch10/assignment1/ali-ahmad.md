# - Agile vs DevOps:
Key Difference Between Agile and DevOps
DevOps is a practice of bringing development and operations teams together whereas Agile is an iterative approach that focuses on collaboration, customer feedback and small rapid releases.
DevOps focuses on constant testing and delivery while the Agile process focuses on constant changes.
DevOps requires relatively a large team while Agile requires a small team.
DevOps leverages both shifts left and right principles, on the other hand, Agile leverage shift-left principle.
The target area of Agile is Software development whereas the Target area of DevOps is to give end-to-end business solutions and fast delivery.
DevOps focuses more on operational and business readiness whereas Agile focuses on functional and non-function readiness.
# - Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment:
Continuous integration:
Developers practicing continuous integration merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible. The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. By doing so, you avoid integration challenges that can happen when waiting for release day to merge changes into the release branch.

Continuous integration puts a great emphasis on testing automation to check that the application is not broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch.

Continuous delivery:
Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. 

This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button.

In theory, with continuous delivery, you can decide to release daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever suits your business requirements. However, if you truly want to get the benefits of continuous delivery, you should deploy to production as early as possible to make sure that you release small batches that are easy to troubleshoot in case of a problem.
