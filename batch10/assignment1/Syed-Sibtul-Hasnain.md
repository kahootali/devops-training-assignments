There are three main options to use with git reset: --hard, --soft and --mixed. These affect what get’s reset in addition to the HEAD pointer when you reset.

--hard 
This resets everything. Your current directory would be exactly as it would if you had been following that branch all along. The working directory and the index are changed to that commit.


--soft 
The Staging Index and the Working Directory are left untouched


--mixed
The Staging Index is reset to the state of the specified commit. Any changes that have been undone from the Staging Index are moved to the Working Directory.
