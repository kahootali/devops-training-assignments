    Container is running form of an application.
    Image is packaged form of an application.

    CMD and Entrypint are runtime command which command will run while running the container.
    CMD is parameter to Entrypoint command it means it is passed as an argument to Entrypoint command if it mentioned otherwise it will become first command.
Q6) Improve the Dockerfile for python Application given in slides using the Dockerfile & then improve it and share image size & estimated build time for it
