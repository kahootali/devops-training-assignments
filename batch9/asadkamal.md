Q1) Agile vs DevOps?
ans: Agile 
In agile method the whole process is divided into different iteration/sprint. i.e., a software having 6 features so the process should be divided into 3 sprint each having 2 features. 
The advantage of agile is to receive feedback after short sprint and make change in next sprint to save time.
In agile you must wait to complete the sprint and then release the feature.
 DevOps 
In DevOps method the whole process is also divided into different iteration/sprint, but the developer should not wait for weeks to complete the iteration, because when the code is ready then why wait for weeks. So, in DevOps the code will release immediately. 
The purpose of this is to capable team so that they can release the feature immediately and not dependent on other.
