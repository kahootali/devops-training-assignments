:bulb: **Question No. 2: How to leverage cache using Dockerfiles ?**

<br />

You should try and keep the stable parts toward the top and make your additions at the bottom.

If you know you need to install a bunch of OS packages in your image (which is typically one of the slower parts of building an image) put your package installation instructions toward the top of the Dockerfile. Because in the image building process, Docker steps through the instructions in your Dockerfile, executing each in order. At each instruction, Docker searches for an existing image in its cache to use instead of creating a new duplicate image.

:bulb: **Question No. 3: What are multi-stage builds ?**

<br />

With multi-stage builds, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you donâ€™t want in the final image.

:bulb: **Question No. 4: Explain Container vs Image ?**

<br />

| Docker Image | Docker Container |
| --- | --- |
| An image is a single file containing all the dependencies and all the configuration required to run a very specific program, for example nginx is the image that you just downloaded (by running command docker run nginx) was supposed to run.<br />This is a single file that gets stored on your hard drive and at some point time you can use this image to create something called a container. | A container is an instance of an image and you can kind of think it as being like a running program with it's own isolated set of hardware resources so it kind of has its own little set or its own little space of memory has its own little space of networking technology and its own little space of hard drive space as well. |
